Q. CounterTests
Please provide counterexamples where the given code would produce incorrect results. Make sure the test cases are valid and demonstrate a failure of the current implementation. Analyze the code carefully, identify its weaknesses, and design stress tests that expose potential errors. For each test case give: for this test: <input...> expected: <expected output> but found: <actual output> and include a minimal reproducible snippet and steps to run the test.

Provide examples
Give me practice questions with solutions
Help me remember the important points for the exam.

Q. MCQ question making: 
You are an expert exam-writer, pedagogue, and subject-matter reviewer. I provided the contents three modules. Using those modules, produce exactly **100 multiple-choice questions (MCQs)** that collectively:
- Cover every major topic and important subtopic across the three modules (do not skip any important area).
- Mix difficulty levels: ~40% easy, ~40% medium, ~20% hard.
- Use clear, unambiguous wording suitable for exam preparation.
For each question provide:
1. Question ID and module name (e.g., Q12 — Module 2).
2. The question stem.
3. Four answer choices labelled A), B), C), D) — plausible distractors.
4. The correct answer (single letter).
5. A concise explanation (1–2 sentences) explaining why that choice is correct and, if helpful, why the others are incorrect.
Additional instructions:
- Avoid overly trivial or purely recall-only items; include conceptual and application-style items.
- Do not repeat content across questions.
- If a concept is especially important, create one easier and one harder question about it.
- Output the entire set as a single numbered list grouped by module (Module 1 → Module 2 → Module 3).


Q. to learn a chapter for an upcoming exam.
Act as a university professor grading a final exam. I need to study this attached chapter for an upcoming test. My goal is to learn the material as fast as possible while ensuring I can answer complex questions.
Please analyze the chapter and generate a 'High-Yield Study Guide' that covers the following 3 sections:
Part 1: The Core Concepts (The 'What' and 'Why')
Break down the top 5-7 most critical topics. For each topic, provide:
- Definition: A concise, technical definition I can write on an exam.
- Intuition: A 1-sentence 'real world' analogy to help me understand it instantly.
- Keywords: 3-4 specific technical terms I must use in my answer to get full credit.
Part 2: Strategic Comparisons (The 'Smarter' Prep)
Professors love asking 'Compare and Contrast' questions. Please identify the 2-3 most likely comparisons in this chapter (e.g., Algorithm A vs. Algorithm B, or Concept X vs. Concept Y) and present them in Comparison Tables highlighting their differences, pros, and cons.
Part 3: The 'Exam Hacker' Section
- Likely Questions: List 3 potential short questions and 1 potential broad/essay question based on this text.
- Common Pitfalls: What is one common mistake students usually make regarding this chapter?
- Mnemonics: If there are any lists, steps, or formulas to memorize, give me a quick mnemonic or trick to remember them.
Keep the output structured, bulleted, and strictly focused on exam performance. Do not ask me questions, just generate the study guide.
