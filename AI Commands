Q. CounterTests
Please provide counterexamples where the given code would produce incorrect results. Make sure the test cases are valid and demonstrate a failure of the current implementation. Analyze the code carefully, identify its weaknesses, and design stress tests that expose potential errors. For each test case give: for this test: <input...> expected: <expected output> but found: <actual output> and include a minimal reproducible snippet and steps to run the test.

Q. MCQ question making: 
You are an expert exam-writer, pedagogue, and subject-matter reviewer. I provided the contents three modules. Using those modules, produce exactly **100 multiple-choice questions (MCQs)** that collectively:
- Cover every major topic and important subtopic across the three modules (do not skip any important area).
- Mix difficulty levels: ~40% easy, ~40% medium, ~20% hard.
- Use clear, unambiguous wording suitable for exam preparation.
For each question provide:
1. Question ID and module name (e.g., Q12 — Module 2).
2. The question stem.
3. Four answer choices labelled A), B), C), D) — plausible distractors.
4. The correct answer (single letter).
5. A concise explanation (1–2 sentences) explaining why that choice is correct and, if helpful, why the others are incorrect.
Additional instructions:
- Avoid overly trivial or purely recall-only items; include conceptual and application-style items.
- Do not repeat content across questions.
- If a concept is especially important, create one easier and one harder question about it.
- Output the entire set as a single numbered list grouped by module (Module 1 → Module 2 → Module 3).
