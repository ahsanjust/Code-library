/*
 * Multilevel Inheritance is a type of inheritance where a class inherits from another class, 
 * which itself is inherited from another class. This forms a chain of inheritance, allowing 
 * each subclass to inherit properties and behaviors from its ancestors.
 *
 * In this example:
 * - The Dog class inherits from Animal.
 * - The Puppy class inherits from Dog, thus indirectly inheriting from Animal as well.
 * - This demonstrates how a subclass can inherit methods and fields from multiple levels in 
 *   an inheritance hierarchy.
