/*
 * Hierarchical Inheritance is a type of inheritance where multiple child classes 
 * inherit from a single parent class. Each subclass gets the properties and methods 
 * of the parent class but does not inherit from other subclasses.
 *
 * In this example:
 * - The Dog class and Cat class both inherit from Animal.
 * - The eat() method is defined in Animal and inherited by both subclasses.
 * - Each subclass has its own unique behavior (bark() for Dog and meow() for Cat).
