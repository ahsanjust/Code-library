/*
 * Comparison Between Java's Garbage Collection and C++ Destructors
 * 
 * 1. Memory Management:
 *    - Java: Automatic garbage collection managed by the JVM.
 *    - C++: Manual memory management by the developer using `new`, `delete`, and destructors.
 * 
 * 2. Responsibility:
 *    - Java: The JVM handles the cleanup of unreachable objects and resources.
 *    - C++: The developer is responsible for releasing memory and resources using destructors.
 * 
 * 3. Timing:
 *    - Java: Garbage collection is non-deterministic and occurs when the JVM decides itâ€™s necessary.
 *    - C++: Destructors are deterministic, called when an object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
 * 
 * 4. Main Purpose:
 *    - Java: Reclaims memory from objects that are no longer in use by the program.
 *    - C++: Releases resources such as memory, file handles, or database connections when an object is destroyed.
 * 
 * 5. Control:
 *    - Java: No direct control over when garbage collection takes place; it is managed by the JVM.
 *    - C++: Developers have full control over when and how destructors are invoked.
 * 
 * 6. Performance Impact:
 *    - Java: Garbage collection can cause performance hiccups if it occurs during critical program execution.
 *    - C++: No direct performance impact from destructors, but improper handling can lead to memory leaks.
