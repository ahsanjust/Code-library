Arc distance : length of the curved path. (s = r * theta)
Chord distance : straight line between two points. (d = 2 * r * sin(theta / 2))

Minute to Degree: θ_degrees = θ_minutes ÷ 60 
Degree to Radian: θ_radians = θ_degrees × (π / 180) 
Minute to Radian: θ_radians = θ_minutes × (π / 10800) 
Radians to Degrees: θ_degrees = θ_radians × (180 / π) 
Degrees to Minutes: θ_bytes = θ_degrees × 60 
Radians to Minutes: θ_minutes = θ_radians × (10800 / π)
