Given an array of numbers, find out sum of all pair lcm.

f[i] = sum over product (a * b) of tuples with gcd as multiple of i.
g[i] = sum over product (a * b) of tuples with gcd as i.
for (int i = N; i >= 1; --i) {
  g[i] = f[i];
  for (int j = i * 2; j <= N; j += i) {
    g[i] -= g[j];
  }
}

s[i] = sum of all numbers which are divisible by i.
then f[i] = s[i] * s[i];
then the answer is nothing but summation of g[i] / i for all i 1 to N;
